# Hi there, I'm Jaël Champagne Gareau 👋

> **Bridging research, code, and creativity — one floating point at a time.**

I'm a post-doctoral researcher at [Université TÉLUQ](https://www.teluq.ca/) under the supervision of Professor Daniel Lemire. My work explores efficient algorithms, data engineering, and all things C++. I love learning, building, and sharing—from cloud servers to the keys of a piano.
